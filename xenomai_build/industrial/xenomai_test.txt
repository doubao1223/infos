## sudo ./switchtest -T10
  --enable-debug 会导致latency

invoked syscall, aborting.
(enabling CONFIG_XENO_OPT_DEBUG_TRACE_RELAX may help)

## latency

    The pre-calibration for your machine is pessimistic, you should
decrease the /proc/xenomai/latency value until the minimum latency
never drops below zero, keeping the worst-case as close as possible to
zero.

	i.e.
	# echo [nanoseconds] > /proc/xenomai/latency

	You can refine this value as the latency test runs in another
window.  Once you are happy with some calibration value, assign it to
CONFIG_XENO_OPT_TIMING_SCHEDLAT in your kernel configuration.

    Please note that depending on which latency is considered among
user-space/kernel task scheduling, and interrupt handler, the most
appropriate calibration value may be different. You have to find the
best trade-off for your workload.
