[ Xenomai 3 requires the hardware TSC feature from x86 CPU ]


== Power management 电源管理
  不应该 disable power management globally

  disable
      CONFIG_APM
      CONFIG_ACPI_PROCESSOR

== USB
  enable
      support for your USB host controller(s)

  disable
      support for "legacy USB emulation"

== CPU Frequency scaling
  disable
      CONFIG_CPU_FREQ


== Configuration Options
  disable CONFIG_CPU_FREQ   ;; 将 充许 CPU frequency 根据负载进行调整.
  disable CONFIG_CPU_IDLE   ;;

  CONFIG_CC_STACKPROTECTOR

  disable CONFIG_APM        ;; 如果配置上了，APM routines are invoked with SMI
                            ;; priority, 会整个绕过 I-pipe.
                            
  disable CONFIG_ACPI_PROCESSOR  ;;  BIOS如果支持 ACPI, 也可以disable.
  disable CONFIG_INTEL_IDLE      ;;
  
  disable CONFIG_INPUT_PCSPKR    ;;
  
  disable CONFIG_PCI_MSI         ;;
  

            

    
    





TSC, Time Stamp Counter 时间步点计数
is a hardware featurefound on a number of contemporary processors.

The TSC is a special register which is simply incremented every clock cycle.
Since the clock is the fundamental unit of time as seen by the processor, 
the TSC provides the highest-resolution timing information available
for that processor.

It can thus be used for a number of applications, such as measuring
the exact time cost of specific intructions or operations.
