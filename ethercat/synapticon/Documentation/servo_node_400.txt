Somanet Servo Node 400 EtherCAT

== About

  Featuring Com EtherCAT, Core C2X and Drive 400, the SOMANET Servo
  Node 400 EtherCAT controls and drives one permanent magnet
  synchronous motor (PMSM, BLDC) up to 415 Watt nominal power.

  SOMANET Servo Nodes:
  		  Meet the most compact and flexible embedded
  		  EtherCAT Servo Drives.
