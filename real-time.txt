real-time, refer to systems that guarantee consistent responses to events
           within time constraints (also called deadlines)
           with low variability regardless of system load.


A normal linux operating system is not real-time.
    例如：toggles a pin on the parallel port every millisecond.
          在Linux上，可以实现为一个简单的循环:
            toggles the pin 并等待1ms.

    大多数情况下这是能正常工作的。
    当系统的负载增加时，循环开始变慢，
      because the process may be preempted
        by the kernel or be swapped out of memory
      in favor of another memory intensive program.
    
A real-time operating system will be designed so that
  regardless of the system load, the program that toggle the pin
  can do the operation every millisecond give or take a few microseconds.


A real-time operating system (RTOS) usually has
  an API for creating and running real-time tasks and
  uses a scheduling algorithm that's different from
    what's used by general purpose operating systems like Windows and Linux.
